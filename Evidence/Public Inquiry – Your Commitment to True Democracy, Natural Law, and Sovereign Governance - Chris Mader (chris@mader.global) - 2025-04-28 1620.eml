Dear Jase Lesage,

As the federal election approaches, I am writing to publicly inquire 
about your commitment to the foundational principles of True Democracy, 
Natural Law, and the Sovereign Rights of the People.

Regardless of party affiliation or independent status, all candidates 
must be held to account on these critical matters of governance — 
matters which transcend policy preferences and touch the very legitimacy 
of government itself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Key Questions for Your Immediate Response:


      1. *Do You Acknowledge that the Sovereign Power Resides in the
      People?*

True Democracy is not the mere election of representatives — it is the 
Sovereign Power of the People to judge both Law and Fact through Trial 
by Jury, as guaranteed by Magna Carta 1215 (Clauses 39 and 40).

Will you commit to restoring this full constitutional mechanism, 
empowering juries to lawfully veto unjust laws, thereby returning 
ultimate authority to the People?

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      2. *Will You Affirm the Supremacy of Natural Law over Statutory Law?*

Natural Law — the inherent rights to life, liberty, property, and lawful 
self-determination — must supersede arbitrary statutes passed by Parliament.

Will you publicly affirm that all government action must be subordinate 
to Natural Law principles, and that statutory law is void if it violates 
these rights?

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      3. *Will You Advocate for Constitutional Reform that Enforces the
      People's Sovereignty?*

Passing legislation and managing policy within the current centralized 
political structure is insufficient.

Will you actively advocate for systemic reform to:

  *

    Restore Trial by Jury judging Law and Fact,

  *

    Decentralize government authority back to local communities under
    Common Law,

  *

    Require true consent of the governed for all lawful governance?

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      4. *Do You Recognize Magna Carta 1215 as Australia's Foundational
      Constitutional Authority?*

Magna Carta 1215 is not a symbolic document; it is the lawful foundation 
of constitutional governance guaranteeing the People's liberties against 
arbitrary power.

Will you acknowledge that Magna Carta 1215 remains supreme and that no 
Parliament has lawful authority to override its protections without the 
direct, informed, and lawful consent of the Sovereign People?

------------------------------------------------------------------------


  Final Challenge

If you refuse to affirm these principles, or fail to respond, it will be 
publicly noted that despite your campaign rhetoric, your candidacy does 
not represent the lawful restoration of Democracy, Liberty, or Sovereignty.

Australians are no longer satisfied with polished policy promises or 
shallow reforms. We are seeking true representatives who understand that 
government exists solely as servant, not master, of the Sovereign People.

I await your formal, public response.

Respectfully,
Chris Mader
Constitutional Law Researcher
Independent Advocate for Democracy Restoration, Magna Carta 1215, and 
Natural Law
