    Dear Minister,

    I submit this formal objection to the “Conservation of
    Intergenerational Assets” policy, and all related statutory
    frameworks including but not limited to the *National Parks and
    Wildlife Amendment (Intergenerational Equity)* and the *Climate
    Change Amendment (Duty of Care and Intergenerational Climate Equity)
    Bill 2023*.

    These policies:

     1.

        *Violate the lawful guarantees of Magna Carta 1215* —
        particularly Articles 39 and 52.

     2.

        *Deny Trial by Jury* — the only legitimate forum to determine
        matters of law, land, and liberty.

     3.

        *Impose unlawful land classifications* under executive or
        ministerial decree — bypassing the People's authority.

     4.

        *Disguise ideology as law*, circumventing the lawful process of
        justice by embedding unverified models and environmental
        assumptions into binding decisions.

     5.

        *Override property rights* and freehold protections without
        consent, trial, or compensation.

    These frameworks are /not law/ but mere *acts of Parliament* —
    invalid where they breach the Constitution of the People. No
    government, Parliament, or agency may override the sovereignty of
    the People or the protections guaranteed by Natural Law and Trial by
    Jury.

    Accordingly, I demand immediate:

      *

        Suspension of all AIS designations,

      *

        Revocation of related conservation action plans not approved by
        Common Law trial,

      *

        Public inquiry into the use of UN-driven and bureaucratically
        enforced environmental policy frameworks.

    Your silence or failure to rebut these lawful facts shall be taken
    as admission and agreement that the current policy framework is
    ultra vires and must be annulled.

    Sovereignty of the People/

    *Constitutional Clarification:*
    The /Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK)/ is a
    statute of the British Parliament and holds lawful validity only
    insofar as it does not conflict with *Magna Carta 1215*, *Natural
    Law*, and the Sovereign Right of the People to rule through *Trial
    by Jury*. Any portion of the Act that contradicts these foundational
    authorities is, by operation of law, void and of no lawful effect.
    The People do not stand under Parliament — Parliament stands under
    the Constitution.
