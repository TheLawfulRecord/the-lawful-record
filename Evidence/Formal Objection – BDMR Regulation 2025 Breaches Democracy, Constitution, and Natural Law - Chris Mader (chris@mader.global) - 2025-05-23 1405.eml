Dear Project Team,

I write to formally object to the proposed /Births, Deaths and Marriages 
Registration Regulation 2025/ on the following constitutional, legal, 
and democratic grounds:

 1.

    *Violation of Democracy:*
    The regulation is enacted without the consent of the governed, and
    without a Jury of the People. It is issued under ministerial
    discretion, not by lawful authority derived from Trial by Jury — the
    cornerstone of /Demokratia/ and /Magna Carta 1215/. This regulation
    is undemocratic by definition.

 2.

    *Constitutional Breach – Magna Carta 1215, Articles 39 & 29:*
    By granting administrative officers and law enforcement power over
    fundamental identity (births, names, sex, family structure), the
    regulation violates the right to due process and judgment by one's
    equals. No free man may be dispossessed — even of name or identity —
    but by the lawful judgment of a Common Law Jury.

 3.

    *Unlawful Surveillance of Identity:*
    Section 25 allows Corrective Services NSW to access private records
    relating to name changes. This is an alarming overreach of state
    surveillance into the private lives of peaceful people, violating
    privacy, bodily autonomy, and natural liberty.

 4.

    *Fee-for-Right Extortion:*
    Imposing CPI-indexed fees on life events such as birth, death, and
    change of name amounts to a tax on existence itself. Under Natural
    Law, the state has no lawful power to charge people for exercising
    inherent rights — including identity and family recognition.

This regulation is /repugnant to the Rule of Law/, /repugnant to the 
true Constitution/, and /repugnant to the People’s Sovereignty/. I call 
for its full withdrawal.

*Yours lawfully,*

*Chris Mader*
