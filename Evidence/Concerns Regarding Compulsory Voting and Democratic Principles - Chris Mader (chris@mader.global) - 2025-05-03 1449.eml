Dear Australian Electoral Commission,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to express some serious concerns regarding the system of 
*compulsory voting* within Australia, particularly as it pertains to its 
conflict with the *fundamental principles of democracy* and the 
*sovereignty of the people*. As someone who is deeply invested in the 
principles of *natural law*, *Magna Carta 1215*, and *people’s 
sovereignty*, I firmly believe that *true democracy* is about the *free 
will of the people*, not coerced participation.


      *Voting and People’s Sovereignty:*

In a *true democracy*, the government is not supposed to represent the 
people, but rather to serve them. The people are the sovereign rulers, 
and government officials are meant to carry out their duties only with 
the *consent of the governed*. The *compulsory nature of voting*, 
however, directly contradicts this core principle of sovereignty and 
freedom of choice.

Voting, when coerced under threat of fines, turns what should be a 
voluntary, *conscious act of civic responsibility* into a *compelled 
duty*. This *limits individual sovereignty*, as it removes the *right to 
choose* whether or not to participate, thus undermining the very essence 
of *democracy* as a system of *free will* and *consent*.


      *Compulsory Voting vs. Common Law:*

 From the perspective of *Common Law* and *natural rights*, the 
legitimacy of any law or system hinges upon the *voluntary consent of 
the people*. When the government mandates participation in elections 
through compulsory voting, it *strips away the true democratic voice* of 
the people and places coercive power over them—an act incompatible with 
*the sovereignty of the people*. In this sense, voting under compulsory 
laws is not a genuine expression of *people's will*, but rather an 
imposition of state authority.


      *The Role of Government:*

The government’s role is not to govern the people, but to *serve them*. 
Therefore, the act of voting should be a *voluntary expression* of the 
people’s will and consent. The *coercion of compulsory voting* forces 
people into the system, diluting the true *democratic voice* and 
undermining the trust in the integrity of the electoral process.


      *A Call for Change:*

I urge the Australian Electoral Commission to revisit the current system 
of compulsory voting and reconsider its alignment with the *true 
democratic ideals* that are meant to govern our society. Voting should 
be a *voluntary act of civic engagement*, not a *coerced obligation*. It 
is only through the *free and voluntary participation* of the people 
that a government can be considered genuinely *representative* of their 
will.

I believe that *true democracy* can only thrive when the people are 
allowed to freely express their *consent* or *dissent*, and that the 
current system of compulsory voting does not serve this purpose. We must 
work towards a system where the government’s legitimacy is based on the 
*people’s free will*, not on laws that compel participation against 
their better judgment.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this 
important issue. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and would 
welcome any dialogue on this matter.

Kind regards,

Chris Mader
