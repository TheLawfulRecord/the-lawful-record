Dear Fusion Party Representatives,

I have reviewed your published values document with great interest, 
including your listed pillars of Personal Liberty, Advancement, 
Ecological Harmony, Safety, Ethical Conduct, and Equity.

Upon critical analysis, I must bring to your attention several serious 
contradictions and deficiencies that fundamentally undermine your stated 
commitment to liberty, democracy, and ethical governance. I submit the 
following points publicly for your formal response:

 1.

    *Positive Liberty is not True Liberty*
    Your model of "Personal Liberty" explicitly adopts the doctrine of
    /Positive Liberty/ — meaning permissioned action sanctioned by
    State-defined purposes.
    This is a rejection of /True Liberty/, which is the right to be left
    alone unless one violates the Natural Law rights of another.
    You thus subordinate the individual's sovereignty to the
    administrative judgments of the State, contradicting the very
    foundation of liberty itself.

 2.

    *Your System Rejects True Democracy*
    True Democracy is defined historically and etymologically as the
    Sovereign Power of the People to judge both Law and Fact through the
    institution of Trial by Jury (Magna Carta 1215, Clauses 39 and 40).
    Your framework makes no provision whatsoever for the People to
    directly veto unjust laws or government actions.
    Instead, governance remains in the hands of policy-makers, experts,
    and appointed administrators — thus perpetuating oligarchic rule,
    not Democracy.

 3.

    *Your Advancement Doctrine Endorses Centralised Managerialism*
    By tethering "Advancement" to government-led technological and
    administrative expansion, you empower technocrats and regulators to
    define "progress" without the People's direct consent.
    This leads inevitably to technocratic authoritarianism masked as
    innovation, with no mechanism for lawful democratic oversight by
    citizen juries.

 4.

    *Ecological Harmony Grants Nature Rights Over Humans*
    Your "Ecological Harmony" policy effectively subordinates human
    sovereignty to environmentalist doctrine.
    While stewardship of the Earth is important, Nature cannot lawfully
    be granted "intrinsic rights" that override the natural, lawful
    sovereignty of human beings.
    This inversion fundamentally contradicts Natural Law and human
    primacy within lawful governance.

 5.

    *Safety is Weaponised to Justify Endless Restrictions*
    By framing "Safety" as a core value requiring State intervention
    against "deprivation" and "risk," you establish a pretext for
    endless restrictions on freedom, property, and association — all
    justified in the name of "harm minimisation."

 6.

    *Ethical Conduct Without Sovereign Accountability is Empty*
    You espouse Ethical Conduct, but without the People's ability to
    independently judge government action (Trial by Jury), your
    definition of "ethics" is merely whatever the State deems acceptable
    at any given time.
    True ethics requires lawful accountability to the People — not
    internal bureaucratic self-policing.

 7.

    *Equity is Used as the Final Excuse to Override All Freedoms*
    Finally, your commitment to "Equity" — the engineering of equal
    outcomes — is used as the justification to override all other
    freedoms and liberties you nominally promote.
    Equity as defined in your document demands perpetual
    interventionism, redistribution, and social engineering by
    government administrators — an approach entirely incompatible with
    true Liberty or Democracy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In conclusion:

Your "Fusion Values" document, despite its attractive language, in 
practice constitutes a *modern progressive technocracy* — not a 
restoration or defence of Democracy, Liberty, or Sovereign Governance by 
the People.

You offer no lawful means for the Common People to check or veto your power.

Your system grants experts and government agents authority over the 
lives, actions, and property of the People, contrary to Natural Law, 
Constitutional Law (Magna Carta 1215), and the true meaning of Democracy 
itself.

I therefore publicly ask:

  *

    Will you amend your platform to explicitly restore *Sovereign Power
    to the People* through *Trial by Jury* on both Law and Fact?

  *

    Will you commit to protecting *Negative Liberty* (Freedom from
    interference) as the highest form of Liberty — not Positive Liberty
    (permission-based freedom)?

  *

    Will you acknowledge that *government exists solely as servant, not
    master*, of Sovereign Citizens under Natural Law?

I await your formal, public response.

If you are unwilling to correct these errors, then it must be publicly 
understood that *Fusion does not represent true Liberty, Democracy, or 
Constitutional Law*, but rather a continuation of centralised governance 
under more marketable branding.

Respectfully,
Chris Mader
Constitutional Law Researcher
