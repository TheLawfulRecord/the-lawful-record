Dear Mr. Gee,

I have reviewed your biographical and policy materials ahead of the 
upcoming federal election, particularly your emphasis on independent 
representation and your service to the people of Calare.

While you present a commendable record of commitment to your 
constituents and regional Australia, I must publicly raise the following 
critical questions regarding your position on fundamental constitutional 
principles — questions that cut to the very heart of lawful governance 
and true democracy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      1. *Where Do You Stand on the People's Sovereignty?*

True Democracy — as historically and lawfully defined — is the system in 
which /Sovereign Power/ is vested in the Common People, who exercise 
their authority through the *Trial by Jury*, judging both the /Law/ and 
the /Facts/. (See Magna Carta 1215, Clauses 39 and 40.)

Nowhere in your platform do you advocate for restoring the Sovereign 
Power of the People to judge the validity of laws themselves — a 
necessary safeguard against tyranny.

Instead, you continue to endorse a Parliamentary system where 
legislation is passed without direct lawful veto or judgment by citizen 
jurors, leaving Australians at the mercy of political and corporate elites.

*Question:*
Will you commit to restoring the full constitutional mechanism of Trial 
by Jury, with juries empowered to judge both Law and Fact, thereby 
returning Sovereign Power to the People?

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      2. *Will You Acknowledge the Supremacy of Natural Law Over Statute?*

Natural Law, which Magna Carta 1215 embodies, recognises that the rights 
to life, liberty, and property are /inherent/ — not gifts from 
Parliament or government.

However, your current advocacy focuses almost exclusively on improving 
services, infrastructure, and economic outcomes — without addressing the 
unlawful centralisation of legislative power that continues to erode 
Australians' unalienable rights.

*Question:*
Will you publicly affirm that Natural Law — not statutes, not Parliament 
— is the supreme law of the land, and that government exists solely to 
protect, not to regulate or diminish, the inherent rights of the People?

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      3. *Are You Truly Independent or Simply Politically Rebranded?*

While you promote yourself as independent following your departure from 
the National Party, independence must be judged by deeds, not words.

Continuing to participate in and legitimise a Parliamentary system that 
denies the Sovereign Rights of the People is not independence — it is 
mere repositioning within the same unlawful framework.

*Question:*
What systemic reforms have you proposed, or will you propose, to 
dismantle the concentration of power in Parliament and restore lawful, 
decentralized governance under Common Law principles?

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      4. *Why Have You Not Publicly Acknowledged Magna Carta 1215 as
      Australia's True Constitutional Foundation?*

As a barrister and a former Minister, you are no doubt aware that Magna 
Carta 1215 is not merely a historical artefact but remains the lawful 
Constitutional foundation guaranteeing the rights of the People against 
arbitrary government.

*Question:*
Will you publicly recognise that Magna Carta 1215 is Australia's supreme 
Constitutional authority and that no government action can lawfully 
override its provisions without the free and full consent of the People?

------------------------------------------------------------------------


  Conclusion

The time for political posturing is over.

Australians deserve true representatives who defend the Sovereignty of 
the People, Natural Law rights, and Constitutional Liberty — not mere 
facilitators of an increasingly centralised administrative state.

I, and many others, await your public answers to these fundamental 
questions.

If you are unwilling to affirm these principles, it must be made clear 
that your platform, while independent in branding, does not deliver the 
independence and lawful restoration that regional Australians — and all 
Australians — are rightly demanding.

Respectfully,
Chris Mader
Constitutional Law Researcher
Independent Advocate for Democracy Restoration, Magna Carta 1215, and 
Natural Law
