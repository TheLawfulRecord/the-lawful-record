Dear Emily,

Thank you for your response.

However, your reply confirms a serious misapprehension of lawful 
authority and the limits of statutory power. While you refer to the Real 
Property Amendment (Certificates of Title) Act 2021 (NSW) and related 
administrative procedures, you have entirely failed to address the core 
issue raised in my notice: the *unlawful extinguishment of physical land 
title ownership without the consent of the people* — and in direct 
violation of /Magna Carta 1215/ (Our Constitution), Article 39 and 
Article 29.

Let me state again, for the record:

    *“No free man shall be... dispossessed of his freehold... but by the
    lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.”*
    — Magna Carta 1215, Article 29

Parliament does *not* possess lawful authority to override this. The 
doctrine of *Parliamentary Sovereignty* is not valid where it conflicts 
with the People’s Sovereignty, as enshrined in Magna Carta and protected 
by *Trial by Jury*.

A statute does *not become law* simply because a legislature passes it. 
It becomes law *only when it complies with the Constitution, Natural 
Law, and is accepted by the judgment of the people* — through *Trial by 
Jury*, not bureaucratic fiat.

You claim that Magna Carta 1215 and the Common Law do not override 
“current statutory law enacted by a democratically elected Parliament.” 
That statement is *legally and factually incorrect.* Democracy is not 
defined by elections — it is defined by the *sovereignty of the people*, 
and the people’s right to *judge the law itself*, not be ruled by it.

I now issue this final lawful clarification:

 1.

    *The removal of physical land titles without jury consent is
    unlawful and void.*

 2.

    *Your claim that registration replaces ownership violates the legal
    maxim: "Possession by deed is proof of title."*

 3.

    *The Torrens system is administrative — it does not create
    ownership, nor can it lawfully extinguish it.*

 4.

    *Your refusal to enter my lawful rebuttal into the registry record
    is noted as obstruction of due process and denial of lawful remedy.*

If NSW Land Registry Services continues to enforce this administrative 
framework without lawful basis, then I will be compelled to escalate 
this matter:

  *

    To the *Governor General* and *Judiciary* via formal lawful submission;

  *

    To the *Public Record* via Notice of Trespass upon Sovereignty;

  *

    And to the *People*, via lawful assembly and declaration of claim.

Let this notice stand as formal rebuttal of presumption and recorded 
evidence that you have refused to acknowledge or address lawful 
authority. I reserve the right to pursue all lawful remedies without 
further notice.

*I do not consent. I do not acquiesce. I stand in lawful dominion.*

Sincerely,

*Chris Mader*

    <p data-start="2220" data-end="2701" class="">However, your reply

                framework that aims to modernise land ownership records
                and increase security, efficiency, and accessibility.
                The Real Property Act 1900 (NSW), as amended, provides
                the statutory basis for the Torrens Title system, which
                has been the prevailing method of land registration in
                NSW for over a century. This system confers title by
                registration, and the Registrar General is the custodian
                of the register.</span></div>

                the courts as a lawful and authoritative method of
                evidencing land ownership. The abolition of physical
                Certificates of Title does not remove ownership rights
                but instead shifts the form in which those rights are
                recorded and recognised. Landholders retain all rights
