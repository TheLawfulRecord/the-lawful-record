*Submission to the Inquiry into the Illegal Tobacco Trade*
*By: Chris Mader — Individual Submission*
*Date: 30 May 2025*
*Submission Type: Public, Name Withheld*
*Request to Give Evidence: Yes*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Portfolio Committee No. 5 – Justice and Communities,

Please find below my formal submission to the current Inquiry into the 
Illegal Tobacco Trade in New South Wales.

I make this submission as an individual deeply concerned about the 
lawful, constitutional, and democratic consequences of overregulation 
and excessive taxation — particularly the State’s role in creating 
black-market conditions through coercive statutes and unlawful tax regimes.

In accordance with your submission guidelines, I request:
– That my submission be published in full
– That my name be withheld from public display
– That I be considered to give evidence in person or in writing at any 
public hearing


      **



      *1. Introduction*

I am making this submission as an individual deeply concerned with the 
root causes of the illegal tobacco trade in New South Wales. My 
background includes extensive research in Democracy, constitutional law, 
Magna Carta 1215, and the role of Natural Law in lawful governance.

This submission addresses the underlying legal, constitutional, and 
democratic violations that have directly contributed to the rise of 
black-market tobacco activity — particularly through unjust taxation, 
coercive statutes, and prohibitionist policy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      *2. Summary of Position*

I do not support criminal syndicates, nor do I condone the unlawful sale 
of harmful goods. However, I assert that the *primary cause of the 
illegal tobacco market is the State itself*, by:

  *

    Imposing taxation without the consent of the governed

  *

    Violating constitutional limits under Magna Carta 1215, Article 12

  *

    Criminalising natural, peaceful acts like growing tobacco for
    personal use

  *

    Creating artificial scarcity and driving trade underground

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      *3. Key Argument: Tax Without Consent Breeds Crime*

*Magna Carta 1215, Article 12* states:

    /“No scutage nor aid shall be imposed… unless by common counsel of
    the realm.”/

This provision affirms that *taxation must be consented to by the 
people*, not imposed by Parliament or executive decree. Today's tobacco 
excise system is a *direct breach* of this constitutional safeguard.

The result:

  *

    Prices become unaffordable

  *

    Personal choice is criminalised

  *

    Distribution is forced into the hands of criminal networks

This is not the fault of the people — it is a failure of lawful governance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      *4. Prohibition and Overregulation Cause the Crisis*

History is clear: Prohibition creates black markets. We saw it with 
alcohol. We see it now with overregulated natural goods. Organised crime 
steps in only *after the State imposes excessive restrictions* that 
suppress lawful trade.

Further, under *English Law*, it is perfectly lawful to *grow tobacco 
for personal use*. Australia operates under that legal heritage. Why, 
then, is it a crime here?

Growing your own tobacco for non-commercial use harms no one — it is a 
peaceful act. Statutes that criminalise such conduct violate 
*Democracy,* *Natural Law* and *our lawful constitutional inheritance*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      *5. Impact on Regional Communities and Small Business*

As noted in your own media release (22 May 2025), regional businesses 
are facing:

    “Violence, intimidation and financial insecurity…”

This is not caused by lawful behaviour, but by a system that:

  *

    Creates scarcity through tax and red tape

  *

    Forces law-abiding citizens out of business

  *

    Allows only corporations aligned with the State to profit

This is economic exclusion by statute — not justice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      *6. Legislative and Enforcement Breakdown*

You are right to question enforcement capacity. But the deeper issue is 
this:

    *Are these laws even lawful?*

No amount of resources will fix a framework built on unjust principles. 
This is not an enforcement failure — it's a governance failure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      *7. Recommendations*

 1.

    *Legalise personal tobacco cultivation* for private, non-commercial use

 2.

    *Review and repeal all statutory prohibitions* that criminalise
    peaceful, voluntary acts

 3.

    *Cease excise enforcement against private individuals* exercising
    ancient, lawful rights

 4.

    *Redirect enforcement to actual organised crime*, not everyday citizens

 5.

    *Hold Parliament accountable* for taxation without consent

 6.

    *Restore the supremacy of Common Law and Natural Law* over statute

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      *8. Request to Give Evidence*

Due to the constitutional and lawful importance of this matter, I 
request the opportunity to *appear as a witness* to the Committee, 
either in person or in writing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      *9. Confidentiality*

I request that this submission be published in full, but that *my name 
be withheld* from public display.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is not simply a matter of smuggling or tax evasion — it is about 
the *right of peaceful people to be free from coercion*. The time has 
come to expose and reverse the true source of this unlawful trade: 
*Parliament itself*.

*Sincerely,*

*Constitutional Clarification:*
The /Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK)/ is a statute 
of the British Parliament and holds lawful validity only insofar as it 
does not conflict with *Magna Carta 1215*, *Natural Law*, and the 
Sovereign Right of the People to rule through *Trial by Jury*. Any 
portion of the Act that contradicts these foundational authorities is, 
by operation of law, void and of no lawful effect. The People do not 
stand under Parliament — Parliament stands under the Constitution.

      British Parliament and holds lawful validity only insofar as it
      does
      not conflict with <strong>Magna Carta 1215</strong>, <strong>Natural
        Law</strong>, and the Sovereign Right of the People to rule
      through
      <strong>Trial by Jury</strong>. Any portion of the Act that
      contradicts these foundational authorities is, by operation of
      law,
      void and of no lawful effect. The People do not stand under
      Parliament — Parliament stands under the Constitution. </p>
