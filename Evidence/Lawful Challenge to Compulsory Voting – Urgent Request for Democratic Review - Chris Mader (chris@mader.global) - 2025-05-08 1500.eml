*Dear Mr Andrew Gee MP and The Hon. Paul Toole MP,*

I write to you both not simply as a constituent of Calare and Bathurst, 
but as a concerned citizen and lawful sovereign under Magna Carta 1215. 
I respectfully submit this letter as a formal challenge to the policy of 
*compulsory voting*as it currently exists in Australia.

While the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 mandates compulsory enrolment 
and voting, it is my duty to remind Parliament and State representatives 
that *no statute can lawfully override the foundational principles of 
Democracy*, wherein /Sovereign Power resides with the People/.


      Key Lawful Concerns:

 1.

    *Democracy by Consent:*Democracy, by definition, requires voluntary
    participation. Coercing the People to vote under penalty violates
    the consent-based structure that defines democratic rule.

 2.

    *Magna Carta 1215 (Article 39):*As a living constitutional document,
    Magna Carta affirms the rights of all free People to exercise
    judgment and conscience without state coercion. Compulsory voting
    removes this right.

 3.

    *Natural Law:*Rooted in reason, liberty, and moral justice, Natural
    Law forbids coercion where no harm has occurred. Forcing individuals
    to vote, regardless of their will, is an offence against this higher
    law.

 4.

    *Trial by Jury as the People's Check:*Trial by Jury is the lawful
    mechanism through which unjust legislation is vetoed by the People.
    The denial of jury oversight on statutes like compulsory voting
    renders Parliament unaccountable to the People.

 5.

    *Violation of the Rule of Law:*As Sir William Blackstone made clear,
    laws contrary to reason, liberty, and consent are void. Legislation
    is subordinate to higher constitutional and lawful principles.


      Request for Action:

I hereby call upon you, as my Federal and State representatives, to:

  *

    *Acknowledge*the lawful argument that compulsory voting contradicts
    the People’s Sovereignty and democratic principles.

  *

    *Table this concern*in the Parliament or relevant committee.

  *

    *Support reform*to restore voluntary democratic participation in
    federal and state electoral processes.

I have already submitted a letter to the AEC, who redirected me to 
Parliament, stating they cannot answer lawful constitutional questions. 
As such, this now rests with you as elected representatives.

Should no action be taken, I will continue to elevate this matter 
publicly and lawfully, including through public notices, lawful 
declarations, and ongoing legal research.

I am not affiliated with any fringe movements or pseudolegal ideologies. 
My position is firmly based in lawful precedent, historical authority, 
and civic duty.

I welcome your response.

Sincerely,

*Chris Mader*
