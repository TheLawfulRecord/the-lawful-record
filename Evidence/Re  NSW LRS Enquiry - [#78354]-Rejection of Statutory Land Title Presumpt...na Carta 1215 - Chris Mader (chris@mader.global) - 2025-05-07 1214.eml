*Dear **Shraddha**,*

This correspondence serves as a formal *Lawful Notice*, issued under the 
*authority of Common Law, Natural Law, and Magna Carta 1215*, 
specifically *Article 29*, which remains binding and unrepealed. I 
hereby *rebut the statutory presumption* that the electronic land title 
registry, held and controlled by NSW Land Registry Services (a 
privatised entity), lawfully extinguishes or supersedes the Common Law 
right of *individual dominion over land*.

"No free man shall be... dispossessed of his freehold... but by the 
lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land."
— /Magna Carta 1215, Article 29/

The replacement of physical Certificates of Title with a purely 
electronic system, and the removal of landholder possession of their own 
title documents, constitutes a fundamental violation of:

  *

    The *right to private property* under Common Law

  *

    The *natural authority of a man or woman to hold dominion over land*

  *

    The *legal maxim*: "He who holds title must have proof in hand"

As *Sir William Blackstone* explained in /Commentaries on the Laws of 
England/ (Vol. II, Of the Rights of Things):

"The right of property is that sole and despotic dominion which one man 
claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in total 
exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe."

The statutory framework, including the Real Property Act 1900 (NSW), 
operates *contrary to this principle* when it deprives lawful owners of 
their direct and physical title. Ownership by electronic registry, held 
by a private operator, *removes dominion from the people and vests it in 
the state apparatus* — violating the core doctrine of a *freehold estate 
in fee simple*.

Furthermore, as *Sir Edward Coke* affirmed:

"A man's house is his castle — for where shall a man be safe if not in 
his own home?"
— /The Institutes of the Laws of England/

Ownership must be proved by deed, not merely administrative 
registration. The *transition to electronic-only systems*, with no 
physical backup, no personal copy of title, and no lawful remedy in the 
event of cyber-failure, leaves all landholders in a *position of 
uncertainty and dependence on the state*.

As *John Locke* stated:

"Every man has a property in his own person... The labour of his body 
and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his."

When applied to land law, this confirms that *ownership derives from the 
labour and consent of the people — not from a government database*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*I therefore issue this lawful declaration and rebuttal:*

 1.

    I *do not consent* to the extinguishment of physical land titles.

 2.

    I *reject the presumption* that registration in a corporate database
    overrides lawful ownership.

 3.

    I assert my *lawful and equitable title to my land* under Magna
    Carta 1215, Natural Law, and the long-established customs of the
    Common Law.

 4.

    I demand that any agency or entity that claims otherwise *produce
    full, original, and lawful authority for that claim*.

 5.

    I reserve all rights to pursue further remedy by *jury, affidavit,
    and lawful assembly*, should this notice be ignored.

Let this letter serve as *lawful notice* and be retained as evidence of 
rebuttal of presumption. You are hereby instructed to place this 
rebuttal on the record against my property registration.

Respectfully,
