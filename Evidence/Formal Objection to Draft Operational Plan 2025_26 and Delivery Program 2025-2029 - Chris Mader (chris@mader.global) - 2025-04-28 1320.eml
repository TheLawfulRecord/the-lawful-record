*To Whom It May Concern,*

I submit this formal public objection to the Draft Operational Plan 
2025/26 and Delivery Program 2025-2029 ("the Plans") currently on public 
exhibition.

*Grounds for Objection:*

 1.

    *Breach of Democratic Principles*
    The Plans are developed and implemented without genuine democratic
    participation by the Common People. True democracy demands that all
    governance derives from the will of the People, not from
    bureaucratic administration or internal committees. The current
    Plans fail to provide any mechanism for direct democratic approval
    or veto by the community.

 2.

    *Illegitimate Alignment with Foreign Entities*
    The Plans explicitly adopt and align Council activities with foreign
    frameworks such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs). It is unacceptable for local governance to be influenced or
    directed by any foreign nation, foreign NGO, or supranational body,
    including but not limited to the UN, WEF, or similar organizations.
    Local governance must remain solely accountable to the People of the
    Mid-Western Region.

 3.

    *Corporate Model of Governance*
    The Plans emphasize a corporate service delivery model focused on
    'advocacy', 'partnerships', and 'efficiency', rather than direct
    accountability to the People. Governance must be citizen-driven, not
    managed as a business enterprise treating residents as customers.

 4.

    *Failure to Uphold Sovereign Self-Governance*
    There is no provision within the Plans to evidence informed,
    voluntary, and individual consent of the governed. Democracy
    requires meaningful participation and consent. Administration
    without direct People-led oversight is governance without legitimacy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Demand for Redress:*

I demand that the Mid-Western Regional Council:

  *

    Immediately halt the advancement of these Plans until a democratic
    process ensuring direct community oversight and consent is established.

  *

    Remove all alignments with foreign governance frameworks,
    organizations, or agendas that have not been explicitly consented to
    by the People.

  *

    Publicly recommit to local, democratic governance free from any
    foreign influence.

  *

    Establish clear, transparent mechanisms for democratic approval and
    oversight of all major plans and programs.

Failure to address these critical issues will constitute further 
evidence of governance that does not reflect the democratic will of the 
People and will be lawfully and publicly challenged.

*Sincerely,*

Chris Mader
