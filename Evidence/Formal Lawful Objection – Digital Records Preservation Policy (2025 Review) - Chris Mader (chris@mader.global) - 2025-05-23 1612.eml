Dear State Records NSW,

I write to formally object to the proposed /Digital Records Preservation 
Policy/ (to be renamed /Accessibility of State Records Over Time/) on 
the grounds that it conflicts with foundational constitutional 
principles, violates Natural Law, and is being implemented without 
lawful democratic authority.

While the preservation of public records is essential, this policy, as 
framed under the /State Records Act 1998/, is a *statutory directive 
without lawful consent of the governed*, and therefore invalid where it 
conflicts with higher constitutional authority.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      Grounds for Objection:

 1.

    *Lack of Democratic Authority*
    This policy has not been approved by the People through Trial by
    Jury or lawful referendum. It is the product of statutory enactment,
    not constitutional law. As such, it lacks the necessary consent of
    the governed and fails the test of Democracy.

 2.

    *Subordination to Magna Carta 1215*
    The /Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK)/ and all
    subordinate state legislation, including the /State Records Act
    1998/, derive their validity only when aligned with *Magna Carta
    1215*. Any part of this policy that enables record alteration,
    concealment, or unconsented surveillance of public information is
    repugnant to Articles 29 and 39, which guarantee due process and
    preservation of lawful judgment by equals.

 3.

    *Risk of Historical Revisionism*
    The principles of "migration" and format alteration, even when
    well-intended, open the door to tampering, revision, and the
    potential loss of evidentiary integrity. True preservation must mean
    *unaltered access*, not administrative reformatting based on
    technological or political trends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I therefore call for:

  *

    A full *constitutional review* of this policy;

  *

    An *explicit guarantee* that digital record preservation will be
    governed by immutable principles of Common Law;

  *

    And an assurance that *no future format migration or alteration will
    be used to restrict public access* or recontextualise original
    documents.

If this policy is to be implemented, it must be subordinate to the 
rights of the People, not the convenience of bureaucratic recordkeeping 
systems.

Furthermore, by lawful precedent, *original physical documents*, 
including *land title deeds*, must be preserved in their original form 
and remain the *primary evidence of ownership and legal standing*. Any 
attempt to render digital copies the sole legal authority over property, 
birth, marriage, death, or other sovereign matters constitutes 
*destruction of lawful title* and is *repugnant to Common Law, Natural 
Law, and the People’s right to retain proof of identity and ownership*. 
The People are entitled to *hold, present, and defend* their claims 
using *physical original records*, not merely trust a database managed 
by administrative decree.

*Yours lawfully,*
*Chris Mader*

*Constitutional Clarification:*
/The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 (UK) is a statute 
of the British Parliament and holds lawful validity only insofar as it 
does not conflict with Magna Carta 1215, Natural Law, and the Sovereign 
Right of the People to rule through Trial by Jury. Any portion of the 
Act that contradicts these foundational authorities is, by operation of 
law, void and of no lawful effect. The People do not stand under 
Parliament — Parliament stands under the Constitution./
